# Introduction

*Motivation*

Growth in the field of genetic and genomic research has vastly increased the amount of available 
data which is often made publicly available through summary statistics. While there are many 
opportunities and new methods to use summary-level genetic data, it is often limited by the 
statistics that are made available. Many post-hoc analyses of disease data require case and 
control allele frequencies (AFs), which are not always published.  We present a framework to 
derive the case and control AFs from Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) summary statistics using 
the whole sample (case and control aggregated) AF, odds ratio, and case and control sample sizes, 
and compare it to a previously published method that uses the standard error (SE), odds ratio, 
and case and control sample sizes to recapitulate case and control AFs. 

*Results*

In simulations and real data, we find estimating case and control AFs using the whole sample AF 
is highly accurate across all settings. When applying this method to the Pan-UK Biobank we find 
high concordance with the known AFs. Conversely, we find that in Pan-UK Biobank and simulations 
including covariates, deriving case and control AFs from the SE underestimates the minor AF (MAF)
for higher MAFs. To enable estimation of case and control AFs using SE, we use gnomAD v3.1.2 AFs as 
a proxy for true AFs to estimate and correct for bias fit. While estimating the case control AF 
using the whole sample AF is preferred due to its high accuracy, estimating from the SE can be used
more broadly since the SE can be calculated from the p-value and beta estimate, which are more 
commonly provided. Both methods expand the utility of publicly available genetic summary statistics, 
can be used when different statistics are reported, and promote the reusability of genomic data.

This document introduces you to the functions in CCAFE and gives small examples of how they 
can be used with summary statistics.

## Overview of CCAFE Functions

CCAFE contains two functions: 

* **CaseControl_AF()**
* **CaseControl_SE()**

The two functions are both used to reconstruct case and control allele frequencies (AFs) from 
genetic summary statistics. 

The user will select which function to use based on the available summary statistics.

**CaseControl_AF()** has the following required parameters:

* Number of cases
* Number of controls
* Odds Ratio (OR) or beta coefficient
* **AF** for the whole sample (cases and controls combined)

**CaseControl_SE()** has the follwoing required parameters:

* Number of cases
* Number of controls
* Odds Ratio (OR) or beta coefficient
* **SE** of the log(OR) for each variant

*Code adapted from ReACt GroupFreq function available here: (https://github.com/Paschou-Lab/ReAct/blob/main/GrpPRS_src/CountConstruct.c)*

# CaseControl_AF {#CaseControl_AF}

## CaseControl_AF() input

* **data**: a dataframe with each row being a variant and columns for total AF and OR
* **N_case**: an integer for the number of case samples
* **N_control**: an integer for the number of control samples
* **OR_colname**: a string containing the exact column name in *data* with the odds ratios
* **AF_total_colname**: a string containing the exact column name in *data* with the total AFs

## CaseControl_AF() output

Returns the original *data* dataframe with two additional columns: 

* AF_case 
* AF_control

The number of rows is equal to the number of variants.

# CaseControl_SE {#CaseControl_SE}

## CaseControl_SE() input

CaseControl_SE has the following required inputs:

* **data**: a dataframe where each row is a variant and columns for the OR, SE, chromosome, and 
position
* **N_case**: an integer for the number of case samples
* **N_control**: an integer for the number of control samples
* **OR_colname**: a string containing the exact column name in *data* with the odds ratios
* **SE_colname**: a string containing the exact column name in *data* with the standard errors
* **position_colname**: a string containing the exact column name in *data* with the positions of 
the variants
* **chromosome_colname**: a string containing the exact column name in *data* with the chromosome 
of the variants. Note, sex chromosomes can be either characters ('X', 'x', 'Y', 'y') or numeric 
where X=23 and Y=24
* **sex_chromosomes**: boolean, TRUE if variants from sex chromosome(s) are included in the dataset
* **do_correction**: boolean, TRUE if data is provided to correct the estimates using proxy MAFs
* **remove_sex_chromosomes**: boolean, TRUE if variants on sex chromosomes should be removed. This 
is only necessary if *sex_chromosomes* == TRUE and the number of XX/XY individuals per case and 
control sample is NOT known

CaseControl_SE has the following optional inputs: 

If *sex_chromosomes* == TRUE and *remove_sex_chromosomes* == FALSE, the following inputs are required:

* **N_XX_case**: the number of XX chromosome case individuals
* **N_XX_control**: the number of XX chromosome control individuals
* **N_XY_case**: the number of XY chromosome case individuals
* **N_XY_control**: the number of XY chromosome control individuals

If *do_correction* == TRUE, then data must be provided that includes harmonized data with proxy MAFs

* **correction_data**: a dataframe with the following EXACT column names: CHR, POS, proxy_MAF, 
containing data for variants harmonized between the observed and proxy datasets

## CaseControl_SE() output

Returns the *data* dataframe with three additional columns: 

* MAF_case
* MAF_control 
* MAF_total 

Each columns contains the estimated MAF in the cases, controls, and whole sample, respectively. 
The number of rows is equal to the number of variants

If *do_correction* == TRUE, three additional columns are included in the dataframe:

* MAF_case_adj
* MAF_control_adj 
* MAF_total_adj

Containing MAFs adjusted using the the proxy MAFs to model the expected bias.

*NOTE:* This method assumes we are estimating the minor allele frequency (MAF). The minor allele 
may or may not be the effect variant used to calculate AF for the GWAS summary statistics. For 
additional details see vignette titled "CCAFE Extra Details"
